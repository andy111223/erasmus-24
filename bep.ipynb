    "### **1. Check Python Version**\n",
    "1. **In the Terminal/Command Prompt:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python --version\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the output shows the correct version (3.12.x or compatible), proceed.\n",
    "   - If Python isn’t installed or the version is incorrect, guide them to download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ensure `pip` is Installed:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python -m ensurepip --upgrade\n",

    "   - Create a subfolder named `src` or `notebooks` inside `BEP_Project` to organize code and notebooks.\n",
    "   - Place a new `.ipynb` file in this subfolder (e.g., `bep_analysis.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Open the Project in VS Code:**\n",
    "   - In VS Code: `File → Open Folder → Select BEP_Project`.\n",

    "1. **Ensure the Virtual Environment is Recognized:**\n",
    "   - In VS Code, click on the interpreter name in the bottom-left corner of the window.\n",
    "   - Select the Python interpreter corresponding to the `venv` folder (should display the path to the `venv` environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Kernel for the Notebook:**\n",
    "   - Open the `.ipynb` file.\n",
    "   - At the top of the notebook interface, click on the kernel dropdown.\n",
    "   - Select the interpreter corresponding to the active virtual environment.\n",

    "     !python --version\n",
    "     !pip list\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "   - In another cell, type:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import plotly\n",
    "     print(plotly.__version__)\n",

    "2. **Basic Python Concepts:**\n",
    "   - **Variables:** Containers for storing data (e.g., numbers).\n",

    "### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Import Libraries**\n",
    "   - **Why?** Libraries like `numpy` (for calculations) and `plotly.graph_objects` (for interactive graphs) are needed.\n",

    "     ```python\n",
    "     import numpy as np\n",
    "     import plotly.graph_objects as go\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Explain:** \n",

    "     - `np` is a shortcut name for NumPy; it saves time when writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Define Constants**\n",
    "   - **Why?** Constants hold fixed values for the problem, like fixed costs, variable costs, and price per unit.\n",

    "     ```python\n",
    "     quantity = np.linspace(0, 100, 101)  # Quantity from 0 to 100\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "     - NumPy allows operations directly on arrays like `quantity`.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation of the Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Why Do Some Words After a Dot Start with a Capital Letter, e.g., `go.Figure()`?**\n",
    "- In Python, a word starting with a capital letter after a dot often refers to a **class**.\n",
    "  - **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "  - **Object:** A specific instance of a class.\n",
    "- In `go.Figure()`, `Figure` is a class defined in the Plotly library (`plotly.graph_objects`).\n",
    "  - **Purpose of `Figure`:** It creates an empty graph object where data and layout will be added.\n",
    "- The code `fig = go.Figure()` creates an **object** named `fig` using the `Figure` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Why Is a List (`[]`) Used in Certain Cases?**\n",
    "- **Lists** are used to hold multiple items in a single variable.\n",
    "- In this specific code:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  x=[bep_quantity],\n",
    "  y=[bep_revenue],\n",
    "  text=[f\"BEP ({bep_quantity:.1f}, {bep_revenue:.1f})\"],\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - **Purpose:** Even though only one value is provided, the Plotly `Scatter` method expects a **list** of values for `x`, `y`, and `text`.\n",
    "  - By placing values in a list (`[]`), you ensure compatibility with the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Why Is a Dictionary Used, e.g., `marker=dict(size=10, color='red')`?**\n",
    "- **Dictionaries** store data in key-value pairs.\n",
    "  - Example: `{key1: value1, key2: value2}`.\n",
    "- In the code:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  marker=dict(size=10, color='red')\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - **Purpose:** The `dict` function creates a dictionary where:\n",
    "    - `size` is the key, and `10` is its value (marker size).\n",
    "    - `color` is the key, and `'red'` is its value (marker color).\n",
    "  - Plotly methods often use dictionaries for styling and configuration because they allow multiple properties to be grouped together.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Role of `f` in `f\"BEP ({bep_quantity:.1f}, {bep_revenue:.1f})\"`**\n",
    "- The `f` in front of a string denotes an **f-string** (formatted string).\n",
    "  - **Purpose:** It allows embedding expressions (e.g., variables or calculations) directly into a string.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "    greeting = f\"Hello, {name}!\"  # Output: \"Hello, Alice!\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Role of `:` and `.1f` in `f\"BEP ({bep_quantity:.1f}, {bep_revenue:.1f})\"`**\n",
    "- **Colon (`:`):** Indicates that the variable should be formatted in a specific way.\n",
    "- **`.1f`:** Specifies the format:\n",
    "  - `1`: One decimal place.\n",
    "  - `f`: Fixed-point notation (a number with a decimal point).\n",
    "- In this case:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  f\"BEP ({bep_quantity:.1f}, {bep_revenue:.1f})\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - Displays `bep_quantity` and `bep_revenue` as numbers rounded to one decimal place.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    - If `bep_quantity = 20.456`, it is displayed as `20.5`.\n",
    "    - If `bep_revenue = 1025.789`, it is displayed as `1025.8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of Key Roles**\n",
    "- **Capital Letter After a Dot:** Refers to a class used to create an object.\n",
    "- **List (`[]`):** Groups values into a single object, even if there’s only one value.\n",
    "- **Dictionary (`dict`):** Groups related settings into key-value pairs for easier configuration.\n",
    "- **`f` in Strings:** Allows embedding variables and expressions into strings dynamically.\n",
    "- **`:` and `.1f`:** Format numbers to one decimal place for cleaner, precise output."
